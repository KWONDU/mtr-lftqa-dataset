Final question: How can we identify users who have not left any reviews?

>> Generate high-level answer using modifed question and gold table set information.
[Annotated answer]
To identify users who have not left any reviews, we can look at the `useracct` table to find users who exist in the table but do not have corresponding entries in the `review` table. Based on the available data, users "Terry," "Nancy," "Rosie," and "Roxi" have not left any reviews as there are no records of their `u_id` in the `review` table.

How can we assess the average review ratings contributed by each user?

>> Verify and modify generated question using table['metadata'] and table['header'].
[Annotated question]
Final question: What is the average review rating provided by each user in the database?

>> Generate high-level answer using modifed question and gold table set information.
[Annotated answer]
The average review rating provided by each user in the database can be calculated by averaging the ratings given by each user. For instance, Helen (u_id: 1) has provided ratings of 10, 7, and 5, resulting in an average rating of (10 + 7 + 5) / 3 = 7.33. Similarly, Mark (u_id: 2) has given ratings of 5, 7, and 6, leading to an average rating of (5 + 7 + 6) / 3 = 6. However, since there is no information available for Terry (u_id: 3), Nancy (u_id: 4), Rosie (u_id: 5), Roxi (u_id: 6), and Emily (u_id: 7) in the given tables, their average ratings cannot be determined without additional data.
