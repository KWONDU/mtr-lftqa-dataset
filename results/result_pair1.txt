You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
To identify users who have not left any reviews in the system, we can look at the "useracct" table to find users who do not have corresponding entries in the "review" table, as the absence of a user ID in the "review" table indicates that the user has not left any reviews. In this case, users Terry, Nancy, Rosie, Roxi, and Emily have not left any reviews in the system.

[Response]
To determine the average rating provided by each user for the reviews they have submitted, we can analyze the "review" table which contains the ratings given by each user (identified by their "u_id") for different items. By grouping the ratings based on the user ID and calculating the average of these ratings per user, we can establish the average rating each user has assigned to the reviews they submitted.
