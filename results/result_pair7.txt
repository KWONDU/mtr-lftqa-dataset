### High-level Question:
The metadata provided in the tables "Financial_Transactions" and "Invoices" does not directly contain information about the count of transactions or how it influences the identification of invoices with the highest activity level. Therefore, we need to adjust the question to ensure it can be answered with the available data.

Revised question: What are the total transaction amounts for invoices with the highest activity level?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
To determine the total transaction amounts for invoices with the highest activity level from the provided tables, we will identify the invoices that had the most transactions associated with them based on the number of transactions linked to each invoice number in the "Financial_Transactions" table. Then, we will sum up the transaction amounts for these identified invoices to find the total transaction amounts for the invoices with the highest activity level.

### High-level Question:
The metadata and headers provided in the tables do not contain direct information on transaction frequency or a direct way to interrelate the two tables based on that specific metric. 

Revised question: 
How can the financial transactions and invoice tables be connected based on shared invoice numbers and corresponding transaction details?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
The financial transactions and invoice tables can be connected based on shared invoice numbers by cross-referencing the 'invoice_number' column in the Financial_Transactions table with the same column in the Invoices table. By matching the invoice numbers between the two tables, it becomes possible to link specific transactions to their corresponding invoices and extract transaction details associated with each shared invoice number, enabling a relationship between the financial transactions and invoices to be established.
