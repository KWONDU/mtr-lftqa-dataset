In what ways can the top contributors in terms of review volume and average rating be identified and recognized within the user community?

>> Verify and modify generated question using table['metadata'] and table['header'].
[Annotated question]
(False) Among the users in the community, how can we identify the top contributors based on the number of reviews they have provided and their average rating given

>> Generate high-level answer using modifed question and gold table set information.
[Annotated answer]
To identify the top contributors in the community based on the number of reviews they have provided and their average rating given, we can analyze the "review" table. The top contributors can be determined by looking at the total number of reviews each user has given and calculating the average rating they provided. This information can help in identifying users who actively contribute with a high average rating across their reviews.
