You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
1th pair
question: Show the names of pilots and the number of records they have.

2th pair
question: Show names of pilots that have more than one record.
SQL query: SELECT T2.Pilot_name ,  COUNT(*) FROM pilot_record AS T1 JOIN pilot AS T2 ON T1.pilot_ID  =  T2.pilot_ID GROUP BY T2.Pilot_name HAVING COUNT(*)  >  1
3th pair
question: List the names of pilots that do not have any record.
SQL query: SELECT Pilot_name FROM pilot WHERE Pilot_ID NOT IN (SELECT Pilot_ID FROM pilot_record)

2. [2nd plausible high-level question]
3. [3rd plausible high-level question]
4. [4th plausible high-level question]
5. [5th plausible high-level question]

[Response]
1. What is the distribution of the number of records among pilots in the dataset, and which pilots have the highest number of records?
2. How can we identify pilots who are frequent flyers based on the number of records they have in the system?
3. Which pilots in the database have not been involved in any recorded activities, and what could be the possible reasons for this absence of records?
4. Is there a relationship between the experience level of a pilot (based on the number of records) and their overall performance or specialization in the field?
5. How can we ensure that the database is updated regularly to include all pilots and their corresponding records accurately, especially for those pilots who may have been missed in the current system?

You are an expert in database management and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the generated high-level questions can be answered using the provided multi-table metadata and header information. If the provided metadata and headers are insufficient to answer the question, you must adjust or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the table metadata and headers to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided data.
4. Ensure the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata.

Final question: [revised high-level question]

[Response]
The provided metadata can support answering the generated high-level question. By examining the "pilot_record" table, we can determine the experience level of a pilot based on the number of records (flights) they have. The table relates each record to a specific Pilot_ID, which allows for calculating the number of records per pilot. This information can be used to infer the experience level of pilots.

Final question: Is there a relationship between the number of flight records of a pilot and their experience level in the field of aviation?

### High-level Question:
inal question: Is there a relationship between the number of flight records of a pilot and their experience level in the field of aviation?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
Based on the provided data, there appears to be a potential relationship between the number of flight records of a pilot and their experience level in the field of aviation. This can be inferred by analyzing the pilot_record table which connects each pilot to their respective flight records, indicating that more experienced pilots may have a higher number of flight records. However, to precisely determine the correlation between flight records and experience level, additional data defining the criteria for experience level would be needed, as age alone may not fully represent a pilot's experience in aviation.

### High-level Question:
inal question: How can we retrieve all records of pilots, including their corresponding aircraft IDs and dates, to ensure accurate reporting of pilot activities?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
To retrieve all records of pilots, including their corresponding aircraft IDs and dates for accurate reporting of pilot activities, we can combine the Pilot table with the Pilot_Record table on the Pilot_ID key to gather the necessary information on which pilot operated which aircraft on specific dates. By merging these tables based on the Pilot_ID column, we can create a comprehensive dataset that links each pilot to their flight records, aircraft IDs, and the respective dates of each flight, facilitating precise reporting of pilot activities.
