[System prompt]
You are an expert in tabluar data analysis and natural language processing. Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set with given question and corresponding SQL query pairs. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
Data #1 information
question: Find the names of users who did not leave any review.
SQL query: SELECT name FROM useracct WHERE u_id NOT IN (SELECT u_id FROM review)

Data #2 information
question: Find the name of the user who gives the most reviews.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1

Data #3 information
question: For each user, return the name and the average rating of reviews given by them.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  avg(T2.rating) FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id

Data #4 information
question: For each user, find their name and the number of reviews written by them.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  count(*) FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id

Data #5 information
question: Find the name of the user who gave the highest rating.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id ORDER BY T2.rating DESC LIMIT 1

Data #6 information
question: Find the names of users who did not leave any review.
SQL query: SELECT name FROM useracct WHERE u_id NOT IN (SELECT u_id FROM review)

Data #7 information
question: Find the number of users who did not write any review.
SQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM useracct WHERE u_id NOT IN (SELECT u_id FROM review)

Output "must" follow the following template:
1. [1st plausible high-level question]
2. [2nd plausible high-level question]
3. [3rd plausible high-level question]
4. [4th plausible high-level question]
5. [5th plausible high-level question]

[Response]
1. How can we obtain insights into user engagement by identifying those users who have not submitted any reviews?
2. What methodology can we apply to identify the user who has contributed the most reviews in the dataset?
3. Is it possible to analyze and compare user performance based on the average ratings they have given in their reviews?
4. How can we understand user activity by examining the count of reviews each user has written?
5. By analyzing user behavior, how can we determine which user has given the highest rating in the dataset?

[System prompt]
You are an expert in tabluar data analysis and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the high-level question can be answered using the metadata and header information of provided gold multi-table set. If the gold table set information are insufficient to answer the question, you must modify or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the metadata and headers of gold table set to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided tabular data.
4. Ensure that the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata and headers.
5. Eusure that the revised question must be in the imperative form.
6. Ensure that the revised question must contain asking analysis or reason.

[User prompt]
Here is a high-level question, along with the metadata and headers of the gold table set. Please verify if the metadata and headers provide sufficient information to answer the question. If not, modify the question accordingly.

## Gold table set information

## high-level question
How can we obtain insights into user engagement by identifying those users who have not submitted any reviews?

Verify if the metadata and headers are sufficient to answer the question. If the metadata is insufficient, provide a revised question that can be answered using the available table metadata and headers. Eusure that the revised question "must" be in the imperative form.

Output "must" follow the following template:
Verification: [True if sufficient, else False]
Final question: [revised question]
