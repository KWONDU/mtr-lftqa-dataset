You are an expert in tabluar data analysis and natural language processing. Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set with given question and corresponding SQL query pairs. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
Data #1 information
question: Find the names of users who did not leave any review.
SQL query: SELECT name FROM useracct WHERE u_id NOT IN (SELECT u_id FROM review)

Data #2 information
question: Find the name of the user who gives the most reviews.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1

Data #3 information
question: For each user, return the name and the average rating of reviews given by them.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  avg(T2.rating) FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id

Data #4 information
question: For each user, find their name and the number of reviews written by them.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  count(*) FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id GROUP BY T2.u_id

Data #5 information
question: Find the name of the user who gave the highest rating.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name FROM useracct AS T1 JOIN review AS T2 ON T1.u_id  =  T2.u_id ORDER BY T2.rating DESC LIMIT 1

### High-level Question:
How does user behavior and engagement on the platform correlate with the ratings and rankings they provide in reviews

[Response]
User behavior and engagement on the platform can be correlated with the ratings and rankings they provide in reviews based on the provided data. For instance, users Helen and Mark have interacted with multiple items and given ratings where Helen provided a rating of 10 for item 1 and ranked it at 1, while Mark gave a 5-star rating to item 1 but ranked it at 2. This suggests that the users' engagement and behavior might influence their ratings and rankings in reviews on the platform.

### High-level Question:
How can we identify the most active users in terms of giving reviews and the ones who are not actively engaging with the review feature based on the data in the provided tables

[Response]
Based on the data in the provided tables, we can identify the most active users in terms of giving reviews by looking at the frequency of their interactions in the "review" table. For instance, user Helen (u_id: 1) stands out as an active reviewer since she has provided reviews for items with a_ids 1, 4, and 3. On the other hand, users like Mark (u_id: 2) have also actively engaged with the review feature by giving ratings for items. Conversely, users like Roxi (u_id: 6) and Nancy (u_id: 4) have not participated in reviewing items based on the available data.

[Response]
To analyze user satisfaction levels based on the provided reviews data, we can calculate the average ratings given by each user. By looking at the "review" table, we see that user Helen (u_id: 1) gave ratings of 10, 7, and 5 for different items, user Mark (u_id: 2) gave ratings ranging from 5 to 10, and the other users did not provide reviews. To calculate the average ratings for each user, we can sum up the ratings provided by each user and divide by the total number of reviews they gave.

To determine the user who has provided the highest rating and the overall distribution of ratings among users using the 'review' table, we can employ the following methods:

1. Calculate the maximum rating given by each user in the 'review' table and identify the user with the highest rating.
2. Analyze the distribution of ratings among users by aggregating and summarizing the ratings provided by each user to understand the overall distribution of ratings across all users in the table.
