###      Step 1      ###
[System prompt]
You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
1th pair

question: Find the contact channel code that was used by the customer named "Tillman Ernser".
SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT channel_code FROM customers AS t1 JOIN customer_contact_channels AS t2 ON t1.customer_id  =  t2.customer_id WHERE t1.customer_name  =  "Tillman Ernser"
3th pair
question: What is the "active to date" of the latest contact channel used by "Tillman Ernser"?
SQL query: SELECT max(t2.active_to_date) FROM customers AS t1 JOIN customer_contact_channels AS t2 ON t1.customer_id  =  t2.customer_id WHERE t1.customer_name  =  "Tillman Ernser"
4th pair
question: Return the the "active to date" of the latest contact channel used by the customer named "Tillman Ernser".
SQL query: SELECT max(t2.active_to_date) FROM customers AS t1 JOIN customer_contact_channels AS t2 ON t1.customer_id  =  t2.customer_id WHERE t1.customer_name  =  "Tillman Ernser"
5th pair
question: Find the name and active date of the customer that use email as the contact channel.
SQL query: SELECT t1.customer_name ,  t2.active_from_date FROM customers AS t1 JOIN customer_contact_channels AS t2 ON t1.customer_id  =  t2.customer_id WHERE t2.channel_code  =  'Email'
6th pair
question: What are the name and active date of the customers whose contact channel code is email?
SQL query: SELECT t1.customer_name ,  t2.active_from_date FROM customers AS t1 JOIN customer_contact_channels AS t2 ON t1.customer_id  =  t2.customer_id WHERE t2.channel_code  =  'Email'

You are an expert in database management and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the generated high-level questions can be answered using the provided multi-table metadata and header information. If the provided metadata and headers are insufficient to answer the question, you must adjust or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the table metadata and headers to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided data.
4. Ensure the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata.

### High-level Question:
inal question: How can we identify the contact number for customers who are active on a specific date?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
To identify the contact number for customers who are active on a specific date, we can cross-reference the "Customer_Contact_Channels" table based on the given date range to determine the active contact numbers associated with each customer. This involves checking the "active_from_date" and "active_to_date" columns in the table to find customers who were active on the specified date. By filtering the data for entries where the specific date falls within this range, we can pinpoint the contact numbers for customers who were active on that date.
