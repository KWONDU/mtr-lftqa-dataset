[System prompt]
You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
1th pair
question: What are the manager's first name, last name and id who won the most manager award?
SQL query: SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T2.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN manager_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T2.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
2th pair
question: Which manager won the most manager award? Give me the manager's first name, last name and id.
SQL query: SELECT T1.name_first ,  T1.name_last ,  T2.player_id FROM player AS T1 JOIN manager_award AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.player_id GROUP BY T2.player_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;

2. [2nd plausible high-level question]
3. [3rd plausible high-level question]
4. [4th plausible high-level question]
5. [5th plausible high-level question]

[Response]
1. What information can be extracted regarding managers who have received the highest number of awards in the dataset?
2. How can we identify the manager with the most manager awards and retrieve their first name, last name, and ID from the database?
3. In terms of manager awards, what details can be gathered about the manager who has achieved the highest number of accolades compared to others?
4. How does the SQL query capture the manager's first name, last name, and ID who has won the most manager awards in the dataset?
5. What insights can be obtained by analyzing the manager awards data to determine the top-performing individual in terms of accolades received?

[System prompt]
You are an expert in database management and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the generated high-level questions can be answered using the provided multi-table metadata and header information. If the provided metadata and headers are insufficient to answer the question, you must adjust or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the table metadata and headers to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided data.
4. Ensure the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata.

[complex reasoning]
Final question: [revised high-level question]

[Response]
The metadata provided includes information about player awards (manager_award table) and player details (player table). This allows us to analyze awards received by players. However, the original question seems to be focusing on managers rather than players. To align with the available metadata, we can revise the question to focus on analyzing player awards to determine the top-performing player in terms of accolades received.

Final question: What player has received the most awards based on the manager awards data?

### High-level Question:
The metadata provided does not contain direct information about managers. Therefore, the original question cannot be directly answered using the given tables.

Revised question: 
Which players have received the highest number of awards in the dataset?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
The dataset provided does not contain direct information related to managers; therefore, it is not possible to determine which players have received the highest number of awards solely based on the given tables. The tables primarily focus on player information and do not include details on awards received by players. To determine which players have received the highest number of awards, additional data explicitly listing player awards or a separate table detailing player award information would be required. Without this information, it is not feasible to pinpoint the players with the highest number of awards in the dataset.

### High-level Question:
inal question: How can we identify the player with the most awards and retrieve their first name, last name, and ID from the database?

### Instructions:
- Generate a sentence-level answer that is fluent, coherent, faithful to the data, and comprehensive.
- Your answer should provide a clear and accurate summary of the information needed to answer the question.
- If there is insufficient information to fully answer the question, make reasonable assumptions and explain them.

[Response]
To identify the player with the most awards and retrieve their first name, last name, and ID from the database, we need to cross-reference the player table with the manager_award table based on player_id. By counting the number of awards each player has received, we can determine the player with the most awards. The player corresponding to that player_id will have their first name, last name, and ID available for retrieval in the player table.
