###      Step 1      ###
[System prompt]
You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Question and SQL query pairs
1th pair
question: Show ids for all employees who don't have a certificate.
SQL query: SELECT eid FROM Employee EXCEPT SELECT eid FROM Certificate
2th pair
question: What are the ids of all employees that don't have certificates?
SQL query: SELECT eid FROM Employee EXCEPT SELECT eid FROM Certificate
3th pair
question: what is the salary and name of the employee who has the most number of aircraft certificates?
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  T1.salary FROM Employee AS T1 JOIN Certificate AS T2 ON T1.eid  =  T2.eid GROUP BY T1.eid ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1
4th pair
question: What is the salaray and name of the employee that is certified to fly the most planes?
SQL query: SELECT T1.name ,  T1.salary FROM Employee AS T1 JOIN Certificate AS T2 ON T1.eid  =  T2.eid GROUP BY T1.eid ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1

Output "must" follow the next template.
1. [1st plausible high-level question]
2. [2nd plausible high-level question]
3. [3rd plausible high-level question]
4. [4th plausible high-level question]
5. [5th plausible high-level question]

[Response]
1. What is the distribution of certificates among employees, and which employees do not have any certifications?
2. Can we identify employees based on their certifications and lack thereof, focusing on unique identifiers?
3. Who is the employee with the highest number of certificates in a specific category, and what is their corresponding salary?
4. How does an employee's salary correlate with the number of aircraft they are certified to fly?
5. Which employee holds the most certificates for flying planes, and what is their salary?

[System prompt]
You are an expert in database management and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the generated high-level questions can be answered using the provided multi-table metadata and header information. If the provided metadata and headers are insufficient to answer the question, you must adjust or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the table metadata and headers to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided data.
4. Ensure the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata.

## Generated high-level question
What is the distribution of certificates among employees, and which employees do not have any certifications?

For each question, verify if the metadata and headers are sufficient to answer it. If the metadata is insufficient, provide a revised question that can be answered using the available table metadata and headers.

Output "must" follow the next template.
[complex reasoning]
Final question: [revised high-level question]

[Response]
The metadata and headers provided are not sufficient to answer the original question as there is no direct information available regarding the distribution of certificates among employees or which employees do not have any certifications. To adjust the question based on the available metadata:

Final question: What is the list of employees who have certifications?

This revised question can be answered using the available "employee" and "certificate" tables.

## Generated high-level question
Can we identify employees based on their certifications and lack thereof, focusing on unique identifiers?

For each question, verify if the metadata and headers are sufficient to answer it. If the metadata is insufficient, provide a revised question that can be answered using the available table metadata and headers.

Output "must" follow the next template.
[complex reasoning]
Final question: [revised high-level question]

[Response]
The provided metadata and headers are not sufficient to directly answer the question as-is. The "certificate" table contains employee IDs ('eid') and certificate IDs ('aid'), but it does not provide specific information about employees' certifications or lack thereof.

To revise the question with the available metadata, we can consider the relationship between employees and certificates. 

Final question: Can we list employees along with their certificate IDs to identify which employees have certifications and which do not?
