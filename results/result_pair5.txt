###      Step 1      ###
[System prompt]
You are an expert at analyzing text-to-SQL dataset. For given question and corresponding SQL query pairs, Your task is to generate five high-level questions that can cover various aspects of gold tables set. Your output should be five comprehensive and fluent sentences. You should focus on relationships between each question and SQL query.

For given question-SQL query pairs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze the aspects of each question and corresponding SQL query pair. Pull out the key points.
2. Group the key points drawn for each question-SQL query pair into high-level topics by combining similar aspects.
3. Generate five high-level questions by properly combining high-level topics.

Please sure that the generated question stop at simply listing a number of simple questions. Instead, generate a high-level question that aggregates simple questions.

[User prompt]
Here is question and its corresponding SQL query pairs. Please generate a list of most plausible high-level questions.

## Input
1th pair
question: What is the first name of students who got grade C in any class?
SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT stu_fname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE enroll_grade  =  'C'
2th pair
question: What are the first names of all students who got a grade C in a class?
SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT stu_fname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE enroll_grade  =  'C'
3th pair
question: Find names of all students who took some course and got A or C.
SQL query: SELECT T1.stu_fname ,  T1.stu_lname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE T2.enroll_grade  =  'C' OR T2.enroll_grade  =  'A'
4th pair
question: What are the names of all students taking a course who received an A or C?
SQL query: SELECT T1.stu_fname ,  T1.stu_lname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE T2.enroll_grade  =  'C' OR T2.enroll_grade  =  'A'
5th pair
question: What is the last name of the student who got a grade A in the class with code 10018.
SQL query: SELECT T1.stu_lname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE T2.enroll_grade  =  'A' AND T2.class_code  =  10018
6th pair
question: What is the last name of the student who received an A in the class with the code 10018?
SQL query: SELECT T1.stu_lname FROM student AS T1 JOIN enroll AS T2 ON T1.stu_num  =  T2.stu_num WHERE T2.enroll_grade  =  'A' AND T2.class_code  =  10018

Output should follow the next template.
