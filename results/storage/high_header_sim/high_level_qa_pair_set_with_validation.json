The absence of this crucial statistical information may hinder a comprehensive analysis of the performance and competitiveness of these teams in the 2005 ANAPROF relegation table.\n\nIn conclusion, the missing average goals scored data for teams with less than 34 played and more than 2 draws in the 2005 ANAPROF relegation table highlights a potential gap in the available information, which could impact the assessment of these teams' overall performance and strategic aspects. Further investigation or additional data collection may be necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the playing style and effectiveness of these specific teams within the context of the relegation table.",

                "answer": "The tournament surfaces had a significant impact on the outcomes of the doubles matches for Meghann Shaughnessy and Marta Domachowska.

In contrast, in the Canberra, Australia match, where the surface was also unspecified, Marta Domachowska emerged as the winner with partner Roberta Vinci. This difference in outcomes based on tournament surfaces suggests that players may have varying levels of performance or strategies depending on the surface type.

However, they faced Boston Bruins on the 2nd of March with a game number less than 61. This indicates a limited number of games played in March during this season.\n\nContrastingly, in the 1953\u201354 season, the Rangers played a total of 66 games in March against the Boston Bruins.
