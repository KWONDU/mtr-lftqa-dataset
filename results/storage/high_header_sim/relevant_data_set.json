The color commentators included Brian McFarlane, Bob Goldham, Keith Dancy, and Dick Irvin, Jr., with Ward Cornell serving as the studio host throughout the decade. Notably, there was no game in 1966 as it was shifted to the middle of the season.

CBC consistently featured Bob Cole as the play-by-play commentator along with Harry Neale and Ron MacLean as color commentators and studio host for the years 1996 to 1999. In contrast, TSN had Jim Hughson as the play-by-play commentator with Gary Green and John Wells serving as color commentators and studio hosts from 1990 to 1993. Notably, the All-Star Game was canceled in 1995 due to the NHL lockout, which reflects a significant disruption in broadcasting during that period.
