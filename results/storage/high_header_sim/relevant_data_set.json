Color commentators included Dick Irvin, Jr. and Keith Dancy for Gallivan, while Hewitt worked with Brian McFarlane and Bob Goldham. The consistent presence of these broadcasters contributed to a recognizable narrative style that likely influenced public engagement with the event. The commentary styles of Gallivan and Hewitt, along with their interactions with studio hosts and color commentators, helped shape the viewer's experience and understanding of the game during this era. The 1966 season saw no game due to a scheduling shift, which may have impacted the continuity of the broadcast narrative.

The number of dances performed by the couples varies, with the highest number being 16 dances and the lowest being 2 dances. This variation in the number of dances performed may suggest that couples who participate in more dances have more opportunities to accumulate points, potentially influencing their average scores. Additionally, the document notes that there is a minimum of 2 dances performed by any couple, indicating that even those with fewer performances can still achieve a score, albeit lower on average. The implications of this could suggest that the scoring process may favor couples who consistently perform over those who participate less frequently, as more performances could lead to higher total points and thus higher average scores."
