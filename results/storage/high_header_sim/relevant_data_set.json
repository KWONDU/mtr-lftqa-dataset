Danny Gallivan was associated with color commentators such as Dick Irvin, Jr. and Keith Dancy, while Bill Hewitt worked with color commentators including Brian McFarlane and Bob Goldham. The studio host for all broadcasts during this decade was Ward Cornell. Notably, there was no game in 1966 as it was shifted to the middle of the season, which indicates a disruption in the regular broadcasting schedule.
