Additionally, TSN took over broadcasting duties in the early 1990s, featuring Jim Hughson as the play-by-play announcer, Gary Green as the color commentator, and John Wells as the studio host. However, the 1995 NHL All-Star Game was canceled due to the 1994-95 NHL lockout, impacting the broadcasting schedule for that year. Notably, Jim Van Horne was also a studio host on TSN during the 1990s.

                        "information": "The version 1.2 in the Zune HD applications game list corresponds to the game \"Penalty! Flick Soccer.\" This version stands out as unique among the listed applications as it is the only one with a version number of 1.2. In comparison to other applications in the Zune HD applications game list, the majority of games have version numbers of 1.0 or 1.1, with only \"Penalty! Flick Soccer\" having version 1.2. This suggests that version 1.2 is less common among the Zune HD applications, indicating that it may have undergone more significant updates or changes compared to the other applications with lower version numbers."
