In contrast, Khanewal City, which has the most number of stores (2), includes stores like Miramichi and Neguac, with significantly higher product offerings, as evidenced by Miramichi's 17,811 product categories. This disparity suggests that while Bahawalpur District has a larger area, the limited product offerings at Doaktown may restrict product availability compared to Khanewal City, where the presence of multiple stores with extensive product categories enhances consumer choice and availability.

In contrast, Bahawalpur City, Bhakkar City, and Hafizabad City each have only one store, which limits the variety of products available to consumers in those areas. For instance, Doaktown in Bahawalpur District has 793 product categories, while Blackville in Bhakkar District has 990, both of which are significantly lower than Miramichi's offerings. This disparity in product availability suggests that consumers in Khanewal City may have more choices and potentially better prices due to competition, while those in cities with a single store may face limited options, which could affect their purchasing decisions and overall satisfaction. Thus, the concentration of stores and the variety of product categories available can significantly influence consumer choice, with districts having more stores likely providing a more favorable shopping experience."

This higher concentration of stores typically leads to a greater number of product categories being offered, as each store may specialize in different types of products or brands, thereby enhancing the overall selection for consumers. In contrast, districts with fewer stores, such as Bahawalpur City, which has only one store (Doaktown), may have a more limited variety of products available, as there are fewer options for consumers to choose from.
