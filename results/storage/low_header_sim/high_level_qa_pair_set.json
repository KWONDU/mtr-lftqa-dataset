In Khanewal District, which features both City Mall and Village Store types, the presence of a City Mall, like Miramichi, with a vast array of 17,811 product categories, suggests a diverse and extensive selection of goods catering to a wide range of consumer needs. In contrast, Village Stores, such as Neguac, offer a more limited selection, with only 1,678 product categories, indicating a focus on essential items and local preferences. This variation in store types within the same district leads to a broader spectrum of products available, as City Malls typically stock a wider variety of goods to attract a larger customer base, while Village Stores tend to concentrate on more localized and essential products.

Despite having a relatively high number of product categories, as seen with Miramichi's 17,811 product categories, the other stores in the district, such as Doaktown and Blackville, exhibit significantly lower product diversity, with 793 and 990 product categories respectively. This suggests that even within districts that may have a similar number of stores, the type of store (city mall versus village store) and the market demand can greatly influence product diversity. The presence of both city mall and village store types in Khanewal District indicates a potential for greater product variety, as city malls typically offer a wider range of products compared to village stores. Thus, while store count may be similar across districts, the nature of the stores and their target markets can lead to substantial differences in product diversity."

For instance, Khanewal District, which includes Khanewal City, has the highest number of stores (two) compared to other districts, such as Bahawalpur, Bhakkar, and Hafizabad, each with only one store. This higher density of stores in Khanewal City suggests that residents have better access to a variety of products, including both city mall and village store types, enhancing consumer choice and convenience. In contrast, the more sparsely populated districts with fewer stores may limit access to essential goods, indicating that the geographic layout and population density of districts play a significant role in determining consumer access to products. Thus, the implications of this distribution highlight the importance of strategic store placement in relation to district geography to optimize consumer access."
