[Generated question]
Is there a correlation between the type of vehicle used for driving lessons and the satisfaction levels of customers based on the lesson status codes?

[Generated answer]
The correlation between the type of course and the satisfaction levels of students can be determined by analyzing the course arrangements table, which links course IDs with teacher IDs and grades. By examining the course table, which provides information on the courses offered, their starting dates, and subjects, we can infer how different courses may impact student satisfaction levels based on the grades assigned in the course arrangements table.
