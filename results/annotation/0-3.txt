[Generated question]
What is the relationship between users, the number of reviews they have written, and their names?

[Verification / Modified question]
[True] Analyze the relationship between users, the number of reviews they have written, and their names.

[Generated answer]
The users in the dataset are identified by unique IDs such as 1, 2, 3, etc. Each user has a corresponding name, for example, user 1 is named Helen, user 2 is named Mark, and so on. Additionally, the users have written reviews, with each review being associated with a user ID. The number of reviews a user has written can be determined by counting the occurrences of their user ID in the review table.
