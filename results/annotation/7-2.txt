[Generated question]
Can we identify any patterns or preferences in vehicle selection for driving lessons within the driving school?

[Verification / Filtered question]
[True] Can we identify any patterns or preferences in vehicle selection for driving lessons within the driving school?

[Generated answer]
The driving school's course arrangement data shows that for driving lessons, there are preferences in teacher selection based on the course. For example, for the Math course starting on 6th May, Teacher with ID 3 is selected, while for the Sports course starting on 13th May, Teacher with ID 7 is chosen. This indicates a pattern of specific teachers being assigned to specific courses within the driving school.
