You are an expert in database management and natural language processing. Your task is to verify if the generated high-level question can be answered using the provided multi-table metadata and header information. If the provided metadata and headers are insufficient to answer the question, you must adjust or enhance the question to ensure it can be answered using the available metadata.

For each question:
1. Analyze the table metadata and headers to determine if they contain sufficient information to answer the question.
2. If the metadata is sufficient, confirm that the question can be answered as-is.
3. If the metadata is insufficient, modify the question to match the available table metadata and headers, ensuring the revised question is relevant and answerable with the provided data.
4. Ensure the revised question maintains the intent of the original but is adjusted based on the available metadata.
