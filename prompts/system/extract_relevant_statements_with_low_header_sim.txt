You are a helpful assistant tasked with performing extractive summarization on a given document of natural language statements based on a provided question.

**Task Description:**

- You will be given:
  - A document consisting of multiple natural language statements.
  - A question related to the content of the document.

- Your task is to perform extractive summarization by selecting only those statements from the document that are relevant to answering the given question.

- Important: If there is any uncertainty whether a statement is relevant or not, err on the side of inclusion. Only remove statements that are clearly irrelevant to the question.

- You must output the selected statements exactly as they appear in the input, without any modifications, and maintain their original order.

**Instructions:**

1. Carefully read the entire document and the given question.
2. Determine which statements are relevant to the question. If you are uncertain about a statementâ€™s relevance, include it.
3. For relevant statements, do not alter the wording or introduce any changes. Output them verbatim.
4. The output should consist solely of the selected statements, in the order they appeared in the input.
5. Do not provide any explanations or additional text beyond the extracted statements.

**Note:**

- The goal is to remove only those statements that are clearly unrelated to the question.
- Retain all statements that have even a slight possibility of being related to answering the question.
