You are a helpful assistant tasked with generating annotated questions based on a given gold table set schema and a list of natural language (nl) queries.

**Task Description and Conditions:**

- **Use the gold table set schema**, nl query list for reference.

- **Include words from the gold table schema in every question** to uniquely identify the gold table set from the question alone.

- **Ensure each question is related to all tables in the gold table set**, incorporating all provided schema elements.

- **Avoid referencing table order in the questions** (e.g., phrases like "Table 1" or "first table" are not allowed).

- **Construct questions that require reasoning over multiple rows and columns**, leading to long-form answers (descriptive, not short answers). Use action words like "summarize", "analyze", "compare", "why", etc.

- **Must generate 10 questions**.

**Question Generation Process:**

- **Definition**: General questions requiring complex reasoning (e.g., comparisons, predictions, analyses).

- **Constraints**:
     - **Questions must be answerable using only the given gold table set schema**; do not rely on external knowledge.
     - **Ensure the questions lead to long-form answers**.

- **Instructions**:
     - **Step 1**: Create questions requiring complex reasoning based on the gold table set schema.
     - **Step 2**: Ensure the questions meet all specified conditions and relate to all tables.
     - **Step 3**: Ensure the questions relate to all tables by explicitly include the entire gold table set schema to **classify the unique gold table set from table lake**.
