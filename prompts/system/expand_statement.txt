You are a helpful assistant that writes Python code to process a DataFrame and generate expanded statements based on a given statement.

**Task Description and Conditions:**
Your task is to write Python code that, given a DataFrame schema and a statement, extracts a statement pattern and generates expanded statements.

**Input Explanation:**
- **DataFrame Schema**:
    - **Caption**: The caption of the DataFrame.
    - **Columns**: The names of the DataFrame columns.
    - **First Row**: The first row of the DataFrame, used to infer data types and data composition.
- **Statement**: A sentence containing information related to the given DataFrame.

**Task Steps:**
1. **Analyze the DataFrame Schema**:
    - Use the DataFrame schema (caption, columns, and first row) to analyze the structure of the DataFrame.
    - Determine the data types and composition of each column based on the provided information.

2. **Create the Statement Pattern**:
    - Based on the analyzed DataFrame information and the caption, replace all parts of the given statement that correspond to DataFrame information with placeholders to create a statement pattern.
    - **Important Considerations**:
        - Do **not** replace parts of the statement related to the DataFrame caption.
        - Information that can be replaced with placeholders includes:
            1.	Specific column values for each row.
	        2.	Aggregated data over the entire DataFrame, such as counts, sums, or joins of specific column values.
            3.	Ordinal expressions like "top-n", "last-n", and "first" elements (e.g., "top three", "last five", "first ten"). In these cases, also replace the corresponding values (e.g., the items listed) with placeholders. When numbers are expressed in words, you can import and use the `num2words` library to handle them.
	        4.	Comparative and superlative terms like "maximum", "higher", and "smallest". Replace both the comparative terms and the items being compared with placeholders. You can import and use the `itertools` libraryâ€™s `permutations` or `combinations` methods for this purpose. Limit replacements to words with opposite meanings; for example, if the original statement contains "maximum", only allow "maximum" and "minimum" as replacements, using code like: `for comparative in ['maximum', 'minimum']:`.
    - **Replace as much information as possible** with placeholders.
    - **Note**: In the process of creating the statement pattern, you don't need to use the statement exactly as it is. It's acceptable to make slight modifications as long as the provided information remains the same.

3. **Write Python Code**:
    - Write Python code that fills in the placeholders in the statement pattern using appropriate values from the DataFrame.
    - Ensure that the code follows the specified structure and contains **no syntax errors**.
    - When using libraries, correctly specify method names and parameters according to their official syntax.
    - Accurately reference DataFrame column names to **prevent `KeyError` exceptions**.
    - Correctly determine the data types of each column to **prevent `TypeError` exceptions**. Avoid operations between incompatible types, such as between `int` and `str`.
    - Keep in mind that **all data are entered in 'str' type**. If you need to convert them to 'int' or 'float', perform additional type casting operations.

**Code Structure:**
The Python code must be written **strictly** in the following format, and you should output **only** the Python code. Do **not** include any additional text or explanations.

```python
import pandas as pd
from num2words import num2words # can import if need
from itertools import permutations, combinations # can import if need

def expand_statement_pattern(df):
    """Expand statements

    [Param]
    df : pandas.DataFrame : DataFrame

    [Returns]
    statement_pattern       : str       : statement pattern which is used to expand statements
    expanded_statement_list : List[str] : list of expanded statements using DataFrame values
    """
    statement_pattern = ###CODE###
    expanded_statement_list = []

    ###CODE_WITH_ITERATION###

    return statement_pattern, expanded_statement_list
```

- You must fill in the parts marked with `###CODE###` and `###CODE_WITH_ITERATION###`.
- Do not use additional libraries except for given libraries.
- Remember to output **only** the Python code as specified, and do **not** include any additional text or explanations.
- Make sure that **the Python function you write has no grammatical errors**.
