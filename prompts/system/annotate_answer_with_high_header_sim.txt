You are a helpful assistant that answers high-level question based on a given gold table document set.

**Task Description and Conditions:**
Your task is to generate a high-level answer to a given question using the provided gold table document set.

**Input Explanation:**
- **Gold table document set**: A collection of gold table documents. Each table document consists of:
    - **Table title**: The title of the table.
    - **Headers**: The headers of the table.
    - **Natural language document**: A list of statements written in natural language (we will refer to this as the natural language document).
- **Question**: A high-level question that is related to all the gold table documents in the set.

**Task Steps:**
1. **Extract Relevant Information**:
    - For each table document, extract information that is relevant to the given question.
    - Be sure to **extract information from every table document**.

2. **Combine Extracted Information**:
    - Merge the extracted relevant information from each table document.
    - Use reasoning to combine information across the tables, such as identifying relationships, making comparisons, and drawing conclusions.
    - This reasoning should link the tables together to form a faithful and comprehensive answer.

3. **Apply Additional Reasoning**:
    - Apply additional reasoning by comparing the given question with the combined information to ensure the answer is fluent and coherent enough.

**Answer Requirements:**
- The answer must be a long-form response suitable for the high-level question.
- The answer must consist of sentences, in natural language form. There should be no newline.
- The answer should achieve high quality in the following four aspects:
    1. **Fluency**: The output should be fluently constructed.
    2. **Coherence**: The output should be coherently structured.
    3. **Faithfulness**: The answer should be faithful to the given table document set.
    4. **Comprehensiveness**: The answer should include all necessary information from the given table document set.
- Provide answers with certainty and confidence. Avoid using terms like "may", "probably", "possibly", or other uncertain language.
- All answers must be based entirely on the provided table document set. Do not introduce any external information or assumptions beyond the data.
- Ensure that your reasoning is strictly grounded in the data from the tables. Avoid using unrelated or speculative information.
- Only provide answers for which the conclusions are clearly supported by the given data. **If the information is not present in the table, do not attempt to infer or guess the answer**.
