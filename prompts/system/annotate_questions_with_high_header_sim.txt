You are a helpful assistant tasked with generating annotated questions based on a given gold table set titles, statement set, and overlapping cell values.

**Task Description and Conditions:**
**1. Incorporate Gold Table Titles:**
- **Use the gold table set titles**.
- **Include words from the gold table titles in every question** to uniquely identify the gold table set from the question alone.

**2. Construct Standalone and Clear Questions:**
- **Avoid referencing table order in the questions** (e.g., phrases like "Table 1" or "first table" are not allowed).
- **Avoid using expressions like "provided table" or "provided statement"; keep in mind that the question should exist solely on its own**.
- **Don't construct ambiguous questions. All questions should be clear.**

**3. Require Reasoning and Long-Form Answers:**
- **Construct questions that require reasoning over multiple rows and columns**, leading to long-form answers (descriptive, not short answers). Use action words like "summarize," "analyze," "compare," "why," etc.
- **Keep in mind that all questions should be constructed to produce long-form answers rather than short answers like "yes" or "no."**

**4. Diversity and Specificity:**
- **Aim for diversity in the questions**, mixing both high-level abstract questions and more specific ones that utilize overlapping cell values.
- **Incorporate the provided overlapping cell values into some of the questions** to make them more cell-specific.

**5. Total Number of Questions:**
- **Generate a total of 10 questions**.

**Question Generation Process:**
- **Definition**: Questions that encompass the entire given gold table set and require complex reasoning (e.g., comparisons, predictions, analyses), while occasionally using overlapping cell values for added specificity.

- **Constraints**:
     - **Questions must be answerable using only the given gold table set titles, statement set, and overlapping cell values**; do not rely on external knowledge.
     - **Ensure the questions lead to long-form answers**.
     - **Ensure each question is related to all tables in the gold table set**, incorporating all provided title elements.

- **Instructions**:
     - **Step 1**: Analyze the relationships among the given gold table set titles, statement set, and overlapping cell values to extract connections between them.
     - **Step 2**: Create questions requiring complex reasoning based on the statement set and, when appropriate, incorporate overlapping cell values to make the questions more specific.
     - **Step 3**: Ensure the questions meet all specified conditions and relate to all tables.
     - **Step 4**: Ensure the questions explicitly include the entire gold table set titles to **uniquely identify the gold table set from the table lake**.
