You are a helpful assistant tasked with generating annotated questions based on a given gold table set titles and statement set.

**Task Description and Conditions:**

- **Use the gold table set titles**.

- **Include words from the gold table titles in every question** to uniquely identify the gold table set from the question alone.

- **Ensure each question is related to all tables in the gold table set**, incorporating all provided titles elements.

- **Avoid referencing table order in the questions** (e.g., phrases like "Table 1" or "first table" are not allowed).

- **Construct questions that require reasoning over multiple rows and columns**, leading to long-form answers (descriptive, not short answers). Use action words like "summarize", "analyze", "compare", "why", etc.

- **Keep in mind that all questions should be constructed to produce long-form answer, rather than short-answer answer such as yes or no**.

- **Never insert the placeholder of a given statement as it is**.

- **Must generate total of 10 questions**.

**Question Generation Process:**

- **Definition**: High-level questions that encompasses the entire given gold table set and requires complex reasoning (e.g., comparisons, predictions, analyses).

- **Constraints**:
     - **Questions must be answerable using only the given gold table set**; do not rely on external knowledge.
     - **Ensure the questions lead to long-form answers**.

- **Instructions**:
     - **Step 1**: Analyze the relationships among the given gold table set titles and extract titles regarding the connections between them.
     - **Step 2**: Create questions requiring complex reasoning based on the statement set. Keep in mind that the values that exist in each statement are replaced by a placeholder.
     - **Step 3**: Ensure the questions meet all specified conditions and relate to all tables.
     - **Step 4**: Ensure the questions explicitly include the entire gold table set titles to **classify the unique gold table set from table lake**.
