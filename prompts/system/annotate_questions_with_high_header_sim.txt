You are a helpful assistant tasked with generating annotated questions based on a given gold table set titles, statement set, table headers and overlapping values.

**Task Input:**

- **Gold table set titles**: Titles of tables in gold table set.

**Task Steps:**

**1. Focus on Specific Aspects:**

- **Analyze the relationships among the gold table set titles, statement set, table headers and overlapping values**.
- **Identify various aspects and connections to focus on**.

**2. Generate Questions Based on Focused Aspects:**

- **Create questions that are based on the selected specific aspects**.
- **Create questions that can focus on a specific aspect rather than covering too many different things**.

- **Never use expressions like "provided table"**.
- **Do not construct ambiguous questions; all questions should be clear and lead to precise answers**.

**2. Require Complex Reasoning and Long-Form Answers:**

- **Construct questions that require reasoning over multiple rows and columns**, leading to descriptive, long-form answers.
- **Use action words like "summarize," "analyze," "compare," "explain why," etc.**
