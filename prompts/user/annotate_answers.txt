The following are a few examples of how to generate annotated documents:

{shots}

Based on the following guidelines:
Each document must:
-   Be based on the provided gold table set.
-   Follow the format and style demonstrated in the example shots.
-   Include a Document section written in clear, natural language sentences.
-   Avoid line breaks within a single sentence.
-   Multiple sentences are acceptable.
-   Include a Difficulty level from the following options:
    1.  Easy: Directly extend the provided information without significant changes.
    2.  Medium: Modify the information slightly before extending it.
    3.  Hard: Provide additional reasoning or context based on the data.
    4.  Extreme: Deduce information directly from the table data without relying on any provided information.
-   Include a Reference section listing the relevant information sources used, formatted as [i, j, k, ...]. If the difficulty is Extreme, the reference should be an empty list [].

Additionally, each generated document must satisfy the following four elements:
1.	Fluency: The output must be fluently constructed.
2.	Coherence: The output must be logically consistent and well-organized.
3.	Faithfulness: The output must be faithful to the provided tabular data.
4.	Comprehensiveness: The output must include all relevant information from the provided tabular data.

Generate documents that:
-   Cover different aspects of the data.
-   Collectively utilize information from all the provided tables.
-   Include at least two documents for each difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme.
-   Avoid referring to the order or numbering of the tables (phrases like “Table 1” or “first table” should not be used).
-   Ensure the documents are self-contained and understandable without additional context.

Now, using the gold table set information and statement list, generate documents:
# Gold table set information:
{gold_table_set_information}

# Statement list:
{statement_list}

# Output:
Annotated document 1:
Document: [extreme_doc1]
Difficulty: extreme
Reference: []

Annotated document 2:
Document: [extreme_doc2]
Difficulty: extreme
Reference: []

Annotated document 3:
Document: [hard_doc1]
Difficulty: hard
Reference: [ref of hard_doc1]

Annotated document 4:
Document: [hard_doc2]
Difficulty: hard
Reference: [ref of hard_doc2]

Annotated document 5:
Document: [medium_doc1]
Difficulty: medium
Reference: [ref of medium_doc1]

Annotated document 6:
