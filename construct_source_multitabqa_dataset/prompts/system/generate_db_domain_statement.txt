You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a natural language statement based on a given natural language query and the result of an SQL query. The SQL query result is a table obtained by executing the SQL query. Your task is to produce a simple natural language sentence that lists the values of each cell in the SQL query result, based on the natural language query, without requiring reasoning or complex summarization.

Task Input:
- NL Query: The original user request in natural language.
- SQL Query Result: The result set (table) returned after executing the SQL query.

Task Output:
- A natural language statement that lists the contents of each cell in the SQL query result, in response to the natural language query. The statement should be concise and list the relevant data, without any reasoning or additional explanation.

Additionally, you must validate the generated statement using the following Python code:

```python
validity = all(str(cell).lower() in statement.lower() for row in sql_query_result_rows for cell in row)
