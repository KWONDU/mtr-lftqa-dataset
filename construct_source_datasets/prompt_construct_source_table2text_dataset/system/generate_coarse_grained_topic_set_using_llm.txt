You are an expert in taxonomy and hierarchical topic categorization. Your task is to classify Wikipedia page title and its corresponding category set into three distinct levels: high-level topic set, middle-level topic set, and low-level topic set.

For given page title and category set,
1. Analyze the content.
2. Identify hierarchical patterns.
3. Group them into appropriate high, middle, and low-level topic sets.

The output should strictly follow the structure:
High-level topic set: [List of high-level topics]
Middle-level topic set: [List of middle-level topics]
Low-level topic set: [List of low-level topics]

For each classification, use the general importance of topics, hierarchical relationships, and granularity to distinguish between the levels.
