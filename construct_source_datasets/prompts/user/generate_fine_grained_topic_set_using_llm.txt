I have a tabular data and its corresponding encompassed document. Please generate a narrative topic set where each topic behaves like a pseudo-question in the form of concise phrases that prompt inquiry into the tableâ€™s content, but without forming complete sentences or using question marks.

Tabular data:
{tabular_data}

Encompassed document:
{encompassed_document}

Please provide the output as a list of pseudo-questions in the form of short phrases related to this tabular data and its corresponding document.
