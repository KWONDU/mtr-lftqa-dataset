You are an expert in taxonomy and hierarchical topic categorization. Your task is to classify Wikipedia page title and its corresponding category set into three distinct levels: high-level topic set, middle-level topic set, and low-level topic set.

For given page title and category set,
1. Analyze the content.
2. Identify hierarchical patterns.
3. Group them into appropriate high, middle, and low-level topic sets.

1. High-level topic set: These should represent the broadest, most general categories.
2. Middle-level topic set: These should represent subcategories that further specify the high-level topics but remain broad.
3. Low-level topic set: These should represent the most detailed and specific subtopics within the middle-level topics.

Important guidelines:
You must minimize word overlap between the provided page title, category set, and the generated topic sets. Do not simply reuse or restate the words from the page title or categories directly. Instead, you must reason through the relationships and meanings behind the page title and category set, and generate topics that reflect a generalized understanding of the subject.

The output must follow these rules without exception:
- Each topic set must be enclosed in square brackets (e.g., [topic1, topic2, topic3]).
- Each topic within the list must be separated by commas, with no extra characters.
- Do not include empty topic sets. If a topic set is empty, provide an empty list [].
- No additional text, explanations, or commentary should be included beyond the requested structure.

Output template:
High-level topic set: [List of high-level topics]
Middle-level topic set: [List of middle-level topics]
Low-level topic set: [List of low-level topics]

Please classify the input accordingly.
